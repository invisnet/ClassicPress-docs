If you have an issue with ClassicPress that you’d like some help resolving, go to our `support forum <https://forums.classicpress.net/c/support>`_ and make a new topic.  Be sure to search existing posts first to make sure your question hasn’t already been answered.

If you just have a question or want to chat with us about something, you can `join our Slack group <https://www.classicpress.net/join-slack/>`_.

Please remember that like all of ClassicPress, our support is a volunteer effort by the community.  If you are able to help answer support questions in the forum, that is also more than welcome!
