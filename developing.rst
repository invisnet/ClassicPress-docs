Developing ClassicPress
=======================

ClassicPress is developed on GitHub and we welcome bug reports, new pull requests and other contributions as we prepare for our version 1 release. Please take a look through our `open issues list <https://github.com/ClassicPress/ClassicPress/issues>`_, or join `our Slack group <https://www.classicpress.net/join-slack/>`_ and ask in the **#core** channel if you have any questions.

Major changes must go through our `democratic process <https://www.classicpress.net/democracy/>`_, starting with a petition.  Please see our `petitions site <https://petitions.classicpress.net/>`_ for more information, weâ€™ve made it easy to find existing feature requests and add your own.
