Testing ClassicPress: Scenarios
===============================

Welcome to the Beta testing program.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We currently have two main ways to start testing ClassicPress:

#. Installing ClassicPress on a current WordPress site
#. Installing ClassicPress on a new site.

See the :ref:`installation` page for detailed instructions.

Testing Scenarios
-----------------

Once ClassicPress is installed, we have a suggested list of testing scenarios.  You are also welcome to come up with your own!

User Profiles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Log in
#. Create a new user with a specific role. Do this for a subscriber role and for an admin role.
#. Check the user privileges match the role (e.g: use a subscriber user to see if it’s possible to activate a plugin).

Page/Post Content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Create a new Page and add some content ( Title, Content )
#. Save it and preview the page to see if the content and title match the one entered above.
#. Delete the page.

Plugins
^^^^^^^

#. Add a new plugin from the plugin repository.
#. Activate it and check that the plugin is active.
#. Check if the plugin is working ( if possible ).
#. Deactivate and delete the plugin.

Themes
^^^^^^

#. Add a new theme from the theme repository.
#. Activate it and check that the theme is active.
#. Check if the theme is working, go to Appearance -> Customize and do some settings adjustments.
#. Check if the adjustments are reflected in the frontend.
#. Switch to another theme and delete the previous theme.

Any bugs that are found can be reported on the GitHub project pages.
